password generator with argparse

=========================================


The following code works with either Python 2 or 3. Uses the  "argparse" library (included with most versions of Python).

Most of the arguments I've written in Python (any version) have been done with if statements. We have a good number of those here, but this is the first time I've used argparse.

I'm not a professional developer, but if you have any questions, please let me know.
